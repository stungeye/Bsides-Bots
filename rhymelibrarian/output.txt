A spectre is haunting Europe--the spectre of Communism.
Communism is already acknowledged by all European Powers to be itself a Power.
The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms.
It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.
Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms.
From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns.
From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.
The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie.
The manufacturing system took its place.
Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising.
Even manufacture no longer sufficed.
Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production.
Modern industry has established the world-market, for which the discovery of America paved the way.
This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land.
Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class.
The executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.
The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.
The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations.
In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.
The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe.
It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.
The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.
It has been the first to show what man's activity can bring about.
The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe.
It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.
To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood.
All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed.
And as in material, so also in intellectual production.
The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property.
In one word, it creates a world after its own image.
The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns.
The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property.
It has agglomerated production, and has concentrated property in a few hands.
The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation.
They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.
A similar movement is going on before our own eyes.
In these crises there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity--the epidemic of over-production.
The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them.
That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.
The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.
But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production.
In proportion therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases.
Modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist.
Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers.
As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants.
The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.
Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class.
All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.
Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.
The proletariat goes through various stages of development.
With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie.
At this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition.
The growing competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating.
Here and there the contest breaks out into riots.
Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time.
The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever-expanding union of the workers.
But every class struggle is a political struggle.
But it ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.
Thus the ten-hours' bill in England was carried.
Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further, in many ways, the course of development of the proletariat.
The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle.
These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.
Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class.
The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product.
They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative.
Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history.
In the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at large are already virtually swamped.
Law, morality, religion, are to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests.
All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interests of minorities.
The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interests of the immense majority.
Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle.
The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie.
Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes.
But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its slavish existence.
He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth.
Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its existence is no longer compatible with society.
Wage-labour rests exclusively on competition between the laborers.
What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, is its own grave-diggers.
Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.
They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.
They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.
The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of Communism.
All property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions.
The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property.
The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property.
In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.
Or do you mean modern bourgeois private property?  But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer?  Not a bit.
Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage-labour.
Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.
To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production.
Capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.
It is only the social character of the property that is changed.
It loses its class-character.
Let us now take wage-labour.
What, therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence.
In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour.
In Communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.
In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in Communist society, the present dominates the past.
In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.
And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly so.
The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.
By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying.
But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also.
You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property.
In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property.
Precisely so; that is just what we intend.
You must, therefore, confess that by "individual" you mean no other person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of property.
This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and made impossible.
It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.
That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a mere training to act as a machine.
Abolition of the family!  Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.
On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based?  On capital, on private gain.
In its completely developed form this family exists only among the bourgeoisie.
But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.
The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.
Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents?  To this crime we plead guilty.
But, you will say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.
But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the whole bourgeoisie in chorus.
The bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production.
He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production.
The Communists have no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.
The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality.
The working men have no country.
We cannot take from them what they have not got.
The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster.
United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.
In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.
When the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient religions were overcome by Christianity.
But religion, morality philosophy, political science, and law, constantly survived this change.
There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc.
that are common to all states of society.
But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, the exploitation of one part of society by the other.
But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.
These measures will of course be different in different countries.
Nevertheless in the most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.
Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
Abolition of all right of inheritance.
Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.
Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.
Equal liability of all to labour.
Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
Free education for all children in public schools.
Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form.
Combination of education with industrial production, &c, &c.
Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another.
SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE   1.
REACTIONARY SOCIALISM   A.
In the French revolution of July 1830, and in the English reform agitation, these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful upstart.
Thenceforth, a serious political contest was altogether out of the question.
A literary battle alone remained possible.
But even in the domain of literature the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.
The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner.
One section of the French Legitimists and "Young England" exhibited this spectacle.
What they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat, as that it creates a revolutionary proletariat.
As the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism.
Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge.
The mediaeval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie.
Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism.
Sismondi was the head of this school, not only in France but also in England.
This school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of modern production.
It laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists.
In either case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.
Its last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture, patriarchal relations in agriculture.
This annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language is appropriated, namely, by translation.
The German literate reversed this process with the profane French literature.
They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original.
The French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely emasculated.
To preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany.
"True" Socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone.
It spread like an epidemic.
It proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation, and the German petty Philistine to be the typical man.
This form of Socialism has, moreover, been worked out into complete systems.
We may cite Proudhon's Philosophie de la Misere as an example of this form.
They desire the existing state of society minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements.
They wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat.
Bourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression, when, and only when, it becomes a mere figure of speech.
Free trade: for the benefit of the working class.
Protective duties: for the benefit of the working class.
Prison Reform: for the benefit of the working class.
This is the last word and the only seriously meant word of bourgeois Socialism.
It is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois--for the benefit of the working class.
The revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character.
It inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form.
Bourgeois and Proletarians).
They therefore search after a new social science, after new social laws, that are to create these conditions.
Future history resolves itself, in their eyes, into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans.
Only from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the proletariat exist for them.
They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favoured.
Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large, without  distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling class.
But these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a critical element.
They attack every principle of existing society.
Hence they are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class.
These proposals, therefore, are of a purely Utopian character.
The significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism bears an inverse relation to historical development.
They hold fast by the original views of their masters, in opposition to the progressive historical development of the proletariat.
They, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently, to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms.
The Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France, respectively, oppose the Chartists and the Reformistes.
In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.
Finally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries.
The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.
They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.
Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution.
The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.
They have a world to win.
WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!.
Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power?
Two things result from this fact.
We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society.
Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce.
And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises?
Proletarians and communists  in what relation do the communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?
The communists do not form a separate party opposed to other working-class parties.
There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.
The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.
What does this accusation reduce itself to?
Has not christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the state?
Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and mother church?
Christian socialism is but the holy, water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.
For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state of society?
In ancient rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves.
All the powers of old europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre.
In almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other.
The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class.
Division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop.
This development has, in its time, reacted on the extension of industry.
An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association in the mediaeval commune.
It has accomplished wonders far surpassing egyptian pyramids, roman aqueducts, and gothic cathedrals.
It has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of nations and crusades.
The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society.
Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes.
Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones.
All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify.
All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.
The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country.
It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production.
It compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, to become bourgeois themselves.
Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism.
It appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence.
Industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why?
The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property.
On the one hand inforced destruction of a mass of productive forces.
But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself.
It has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons--the modern working class--the proletarians.
Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois state.
They are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself.
They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments of production themselves.
Thus the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie.
Every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie.
But with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number.
It becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more.
The unceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more precarious.
The collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes.
Thereupon the workers begin to form combinations (trades unions) against the bourgeois.
The proletarian is without property.
His relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family-relations.
They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify.
Their mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property.
The essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of the bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of capital.
The condition for capital is wage-labour.
Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property!
Do you mean the property of the petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form?
But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population.
Its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths.
Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society.
All that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriation.
According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness.
For those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not work.
The communists have not invented the intervention of society in education.
They do but seek to alter the character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.
But communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis.
It therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.
The communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations.
No wonder that its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.
Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state.
The bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries.
Gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country, by a more equable distribution of the population over the country.
In this way arose feudal socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon.
Half echo of the past, half menace of the future.
At times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the bourgeoisie to the very heart's core.
But always ludicrous in its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history.
In political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive measures against the working class.
It proved, incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour.
The concentration of capital and land in a few hands.
The industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction.
On the one hand, from the concentration of capital; on the other, from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat.
The bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best.
And bourgeois socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems.
Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary, action.
They, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of the working class.
Such action, according to them, can only result from blind unbelief in the new gospel.
The communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class.
But in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of that movement.
